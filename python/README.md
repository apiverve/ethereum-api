## Installation

Using `pip`:

```bash
pip install apiverve-ethereumprice
```

Using `pip3`:

```bash
pip3 install apiverve-ethereumprice
```

## Configuration

Before using the ethereum API client, you have to setup your account and obtain your API Key.
You can get it by signing up at [https://apiverve.com](https://apiverve.com?utm_source=pypi&utm_medium=readme)

---

## Quick Start

Here's a simple example to get you started quickly:

```python
from apiverve_ethereumprice.apiClient import EthereumAPIClient

# Initialize the client with your APIVerve API key
api = EthereumAPIClient("[YOUR_API_KEY]")

query = { "currency": "USD" }

try:
    # Make the API call
    result = api.execute(query)

    # Print the result
    print(result)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
```

---

## Usage

The Ethereum Price API documentation is found here: [https://docs.apiverve.com/ref/ethereum](https://docs.apiverve.com/ref/ethereum?utm_source=pypi&utm_medium=readme).
You can find parameters, example responses, and status codes documented here.

### Setup

```python
# Import the client module
from apiverve_ethereumprice.apiClient import EthereumAPIClient

# Initialize the client with your APIVerve API key
api = EthereumAPIClient("[YOUR_API_KEY]")
```

---

## Perform Request

Using the API client, you can perform requests to the API.

###### Define Query

```python
query = { "currency": "USD" }
```

###### Simple Request

```python
# Make a request to the API
result = api.execute(query)

# Print the result
print(result)
```

###### Example Response

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "error": null,
  "data": {
    "currency": "USD",
    "price": 2685.12,
    "marketCap": 323000000000,
    "volume24h": 14850000000,
    "change24h": 2.34,
    "lastUpdated": "2026-02-07T12:00:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

## Error Handling

The API client provides comprehensive error handling through the `EthereumAPIClientError` exception. Here are some examples:

### Basic Error Handling

```python
from apiverve_ethereumprice.apiClient import EthereumAPIClient, EthereumAPIClientError

api = EthereumAPIClient("[YOUR_API_KEY]")

query = { "currency": "USD" }

try:
    result = api.execute(query)
    print("Success!")
    print(result)
except EthereumAPIClientError as e:
    print(f"API Error: {e.message}")
    if e.status_code:
        print(f"Status Code: {e.status_code}")
    if e.response:
        print(f"Response: {e.response}")
```

### Handling Specific Error Types

```python
from apiverve_ethereumprice.apiClient import EthereumAPIClient, EthereumAPIClientError

api = EthereumAPIClient("[YOUR_API_KEY]")

query = { "currency": "USD" }

try:
    result = api.execute(query)

    # Check for successful response
    if result.get('status') == 'success':
        print("Request successful!")
        print(result.get('data'))
    else:
        print(f"API returned an error: {result.get('error')}")

except EthereumAPIClientError as e:
    # Handle API client errors
    if e.status_code == 401:
        print("Unauthorized: Invalid API key")
    elif e.status_code == 429:
        print("Rate limit exceeded")
    elif e.status_code >= 500:
        print("Server error - please try again later")
    else:
        print(f"API error: {e.message}")
except Exception as e:
    # Handle unexpected errors
    print(f"Unexpected error: {str(e)}")
```

### Using Context Manager (Recommended)

The client supports the context manager protocol for automatic resource cleanup:

```python
from apiverve_ethereumprice.apiClient import EthereumAPIClient, EthereumAPIClientError

query = { "currency": "USD" }

# Using context manager ensures proper cleanup
with EthereumAPIClient("[YOUR_API_KEY]") as api:
    try:
        result = api.execute(query)
        print(result)
    except EthereumAPIClientError as e:
        print(f"Error: {e.message}")
# Session is automatically closed here
```

---

## Advanced Features

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging to see detailed request and response information:

```python
from apiverve_ethereumprice.apiClient import EthereumAPIClient

# Enable debug mode
api = EthereumAPIClient("[YOUR_API_KEY]", debug=True)

query = { "currency": "USD" }

# Debug information will be printed to console
result = api.execute(query)
```

### Manual Session Management

If you need to manually manage the session lifecycle:

```python
from apiverve_ethereumprice.apiClient import EthereumAPIClient

api = EthereumAPIClient("[YOUR_API_KEY]")

try:
    query = { "currency": "USD" }
    result = api.execute(query)
    print(result)
finally:
    # Manually close the session when done
    api.close()
```
